// Find the calculation type (7Kyu)

/*
You have to create a function calcType, which receives 3 arguments: 2 numbers, and the result of an unknown operation performed on them (also a number).

Based on those 3 values you have to return a string, that describes which operation was used to get the given result.

The possible return strings are: "addition", "subtraction", "multiplication", "division".

Example:
calcType(1, 2, 3) -->   1 ? 2 = 3   --> "addition"
