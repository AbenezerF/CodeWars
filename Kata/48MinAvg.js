/* NBA full 48 minutes average (8kyu)

An NBA game runs 48 minutes (Four 12 minute quarters). Players do not typically 
play the full game, subbing in and out as necessary. Your job is to extrapolate a 
player's points per game if they played the full 48 minutes.

Write a function that takes two arguments, ppg (points per game) and mpg 
(minutes per game) and returns a straight extrapolation of ppg per 48 minutes 
rounded to the nearest tenth. Return 0 if 0.

Examples:

pointsPer48(12, 20) // 28.8
pointsPer48(10, 10) // 48 
pointsPer48(5, 17) // 14.1 
pointsPer48(0, 0) // 0
*/

// first solution
function pointsPer48(ppg, mpg) {
    if(ppg === 0) return 0;
    let num = (ppg / mpg) * 48;
    return Number(num.toFixed(1));
}

  // shortest solution
function pointsPer48(ppg, mpg) {
    return +(ppg/mpg*48).toFixed(1)||0
}
