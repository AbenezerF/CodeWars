/* Find out whether the shape is a cube (8kyu)
To find the volume (centimeters cubed) of a cuboid you use the formula:

volume = Length * Width * Height

But someone forgot to use proper record keeping, so we only have the volume, and the length of a single side!

It's up to you to find out whether the cuboid has equal sides (= is a cube).

Return true if the cuboid could have equal sides, return false otherwise.

Return false for invalid numbers too (e.g volume or side is less than or equal to 0).

Note: the sides must be integers
*/

var cubeChecker = function(volume, side){
    return Math.pow(side, 3) === volume && side > 0;
  };
